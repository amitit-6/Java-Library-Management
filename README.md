# Java-Library-Management

This is a basic **object-oriented Java CLI application** to manage a simple library system. Built as part of my internship at **Elevate Labs**, it demonstrates core OOP concepts using multiple classes.

- View all available books
- Issue books to users (by Book ID and User ID)
- Return books

## 👨‍💻 Classes Used

- `Book`: Represents a book with ID, title, and issue status
- `User`: Represents a user (can be extended further)
- `Library`: Manages books and operations like issue/return

2. Run: `java LibraryManagementSystem`
